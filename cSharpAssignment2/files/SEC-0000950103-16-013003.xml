We use Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as our operating income plus depreciation and amortization plus/minus the following losses/gains included within other operating expenses, net, and within general and administrative expenses in our statement of income: compensation expense related to a special award granted to our CEO; incremental compensation expense, including the compensation related to the extension of our 2008 long-term incentive plan; gains from sale or insurance recovery of property and equipment; write-offs and related contingencies of property and equipment; impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill; stock-based compensation related to the special awards under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan; bonuses granted in connection with our initial public offering; reorganization and optimization plan expenses.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[144]">We believe Adjusted EBITDA facilitates company-to-company operating performance comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations such as capital structures (affecting net interest expense and other financial charges), taxation (affecting income tax expense) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense), which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance. In addition, we exclude gains from sale or insurance recovery of property and equipment not related to our core business; write-offs and related contingencies of property and equipment and impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill that do not result in cash payments; compensation expense related to the award granted to our CEO; stock-based compensation related to the special awards under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan; incremental compensation expense related to the extension of our 2008 long-term incentive plan, reorganization and optimization plan expenses; and bonuses granted in connection with our initial public offering due to its special nature. In addition, in 2011 we excluded the incremental compensation expense that resulted from the remeasurement of our liability under our 2008 long-term incentive plan because of our decision in 2011 to replace the existing formula for determining the current value of the award with the quoted market price of our shares. While a GAAP measure for purposes of our segment reporting, Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure for reporting our total Company performance. Our management believes, however, that disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors, financial analysts and the public in their evaluation of our operating performance.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[146]">Market Share and Other Information</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[148]">Market data and certain industry forecast data used in this annual report were obtained from internal reports and studies, where appropriate, as well as estimates, market research, publicly available information (including information available from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, website) and industry publications, including Millward Brown Optimor, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the CIA World Factbook.

However, as of the date hereof, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, resident individuals, legal entities from the private sector organized in Argentina and not authorized to deal in foreign exchange, certain trusts and other estates domiciled in Argentina, as well as Argentine local governments will be allowed access to the local foreign exchange market without the prior authorization of the Central Bank of Argentina to purchase foreign currency without specific allocation (</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[301]/html:i[2]">atesoramiento</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[301]">) for up to U.S.$2.0 million per calendar month.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[303]/html:i">Dividends</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[303]">.

Pursuant to the MFAs, McDonald's will determine whether to grant us the option to renew between August 2020 and August 2024.

For example, under the MFAs, we are not permitted to operate any other QSR chains, we must comply with McDonald's high-quality standards, we must own and operate at least 50% of all McDonald's-branded restaurants in the Territories, we must maintain certain guarantees in favor of McDonald's, including a standby letter of credit (or other similar financial guarantee acceptable to McDonald's) in an amount of $80.0 million, to secure our payment obligations under the MFAs and related credit documents, we cannot incur debt above certain financial ratios, we cannot transfer the equity interests of our subsidiaries, any significant portion of their assets or any of the real estate properties we own without McDonald's consent, and McDonald's has the right to approve the appointment of our chief executive officer and chief operating officer. In addition, the MFAs require us to reinvest a significant amount of money, including through reimaging our existing restaurants, opening new restaurants and advertising, which plans McDonald's has the right to approve. Under the 2014-2016 restaurant opening and reinvestment plan, we were required to open 250 restaurants and spend $180 million from 2014 through 2016. On August 10, 2015, however, we reached an agreement with McDonald's to amend the 2014-2016 opening plan, mainly in order to adjust this plan to the current economic realities of the region. Under the revised plan, we committed to opening a minimum of 150 new restaurants over the three-year period, down from the original 250. The Company is also committed to executing at least 140 reimages over the three-year period. We estimate that the cost to comply with our restaurant opening commitments under the MFAs from 2014 through 2016 will be between $151 million and $181 million, depending on, among other factors, the type and location of the restaurants we open.

During the waiver period we were not required to maintain these quarterly financial ratios; however, we will need to obtain an extension of the MFA waiver to avoid breaching our commitments under the MFA. If we are unable to obtain an extension of the waiver or to comply with our original commitments under the MFA, we could be in material breach.

In addition, if there is a material breach that relates to one or more Territories in which there are at least 100 restaurants in operation, McDonald's has the right either to acquire all of our non-public shares or our interests in our subsidiaries in such Territory or Territories. By contrast, if the initial material breach of the MFAs affects or is attributable to any of the Territories in which there are less than 100 restaurants in operation, McDonald's only has the right to acquire the equity interests of any of our subsidiaries in the relevant Territory. For example, since we have more than 100 restaurants in Mexico, if a Mexican subsidiary were to materially breach the MFA, McDonald's would have the right either to acquire our entire business throughout Latin America and the Caribbean or just our Mexican operations, whereas upon a similar breach by our Ecuadorean subsidiary, McDonald's would only have the right to acquire our interests in our operations in Ecuador.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[383]">McDonald's was granted a perfected security interest in the equity interests of LatAm, LLC, Arcos Dourados Comercio de Alimentos Ltda. and certain of their subsidiaries to protect this right.

We use McDonald's centralized supply chain management model, which relies on approved third-party suppliers and distributors for goods, and we generally use several suppliers to satisfy our needs for goods. This system encompasses selecting and developing suppliers of core products-beef, chicken, buns, produce, cheese, dairy mixes, beverages and toppings-who are able to comply with McDonald's high-quality standards, and establishing sustainable relationships with these suppliers. McDonald's standards include cleanliness, product consistency, timeliness, following internationally recognized manufacturing practices, meeting or exceeding all local food regulations and compliance with our Hazard Analysis Critical Control Plan, a systematic approach to food safety that emphasizes protection within the processing facility, rather than detection, through analysis, inspection and follow-up.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[401]">Our 35 largest suppliers account for approximately 80% of our purchases. Very few of our suppliers have entered into written contracts with us as we only have oral agreements with a vast majority of them. Our supplier approval process is thorough and lengthy in order to ensure compliance with McDonald's high-quality standards. We therefore tend to develop strong relationships with approved suppliers and, given our importance to them, have found that oral agreements with them are generally sufficient to ensure a reliable supply of quality products. While we source our supplies from many approved suppliers in Latin America and the Caribbean, thereby reducing our dependence on any one supplier, the informal nature of the majority of our relationships with suppliers means that we may not be assured of long-term or reliable supplies of products from those suppliers.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[403]">In addition, certain supplies, such as beef, must often be locally sourced due to restrictions on their importation.

The cost of food and supplies depends on several factors, including global supply and demand, new product offerings, weather conditions, fluctuations in energy costs and tax incentives, all of which makes us susceptible to substantial price and currency fluctuations and other increased operating costs.

Since a majority of our board of directors may not consist of independent directors as long as we rely on the foreign private issuer exemption to these NYSE requirements, our board's approach may, therefore, be different from that of a board with a majority of independent directors, and as a result, the management oversight of our Company may be more limited than if we were subject to these NYSE requirements.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[651]">Certain Risks Relating to Investing in a British Virgin Islands Company</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[653]">We are a British Virgin Islands company and it may be difficult for you to obtain or enforce judgments against us or our executive officers and directors in the United States.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[655]">We are incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands.

Pricing under the agreement is determined pursuant to an agreed-upon formula that is considered standard in the distribution services industry. Axionlog must also comply with McDonald's quality program, the Distributor Quality Management System (DQMP). The pricing formula considers certain variables to determine the applicable fees, including (i) cost inputs (i.e., Fuel, transportation expenses and salaries); (ii) time required for completion, (iii) storage requirements; (iv) merchandise volume; and (v) inflation and exchange rate adjustments. We use similar pricing formulas with our other distribution service providers in the territories not covered by Axionlog. Under the terms of the agreement, the pricing formula is reviewed on a yearly basis. In addition, we or Axionlog may request a renegotiation of the pricing formula in the event that, due to factors outside of our or their control, the formula is substantially altered based on changes to its variable inputs.

Under our conventional franchise arrangements, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and decor of their restaurants, and by reinvesting in the business over time. We are required by the MFAs to own the real estate or to secure long-term leases for franchised restaurant sites. We subsequently lease or sublease the property to franchisees. This arrangement allows for long-term occupancy of the property and assists in the alignment of our franchisees' interests with our own.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[767]">In exchange for the lease and services, franchisees pay a monthly rent to us, generally based on the greater of a fixed rent or a certain percentage of gross sales.

However, if a franchisee fails to pay its monthly continuing franchise fee, we remain liable for payment in full of these fees to McDonald's. Pursuant to the MFAs, franchisees pay an initial franchise fee in connection with the opening of a new franchised restaurant and a transfer fee upon transfer of a franchised restaurant, both of which are subsequently shared by McDonald's and us.

Food court restaurants are located in malls and consist primarily of a front counter and kitchen and do not have their own seating area. In-store restaurants are part of a larger building, but they do not have a drive-thru area or a parking lot. Mall stores are located in malls like food court restaurants, but have their own seating areas. As of December 31, 2015, 1,006 (or 47%) of our restaurants were freestanding, 496 (or 23%) were food courts, 297 (or 14%) were in-stores and 342 (or 16%) were mall stores.

As of December 31, 2015, we had completed the reimaging of 593 of the 1,569 restaurants we purchased in the Acquisition, an increase of 44 restaurants as compared to December 31, 2014. Our restaurants that have undergone reimaging during the past three years have experienced an additional increase in sales per restaurant over the comparable sales growth experienced by restaurants which have not been reimaged in the same period. Both we and McDonald's are committed to maintaining an image for our restaurants that creates a contemporary dining experience. Over the last few years, we have invested substantially in the reimaging of our restaurants, and we, pursuant to the MFAs, have committed to a significant reimaging plan. See "ITEM 10.

McCafé locations are stylish, separate areas within restaurants where customers can purchase a variety of customizable beverages, including lattes, cappuccinos, mochas, hot and iced premium coffees and hot chocolate. McCafé locations have been very successful in creating a different customer experience, optimizing the use of our restaurants at all hours of operation and providing a higher profit margin than our regular restaurant operations. We believe the primary benefit of McCafé locations is that they attract new customers by increasing the variety of our product offerings and improving our image.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[803]">With an average return on investment from McCafé locations of 45% in 2015, the McCafé concept is well-suited for restaurants in large-scale shopping centers and commercial areas. McCafé locations have been a key factor in adding value to our customers' experience and represented 9.3% of the total transactions and 6.3% of total sales of the restaurants in which they were located in 2015. As of December 31, 2015, there were 321 McCafé locations in the Territories, of which 13.4% were operated by franchisees. Argentina and Brazil, with 87 and 92 locations, respectively, have the greatest number of McCafé locations. The first McCafé in Latin America was opened in Argentina in 1999.

Dessert Centers operate separately from existing restaurants, but depend on them for supplies and operational support. For example, a mall store restaurant can provide support for several Dessert Centers located in different locations throughout the same mall. Our Dessert Centers are conveniently located to attract customers, thereby serving as important transaction generators and providing an effective method of extending our band presence to non-traditional areas. At Dessert Centers, customers can purchase a variety of dessert items, including the McFlurry and soft-serve ice cream. Dessert Centers require low capital expenditures and provide returns on investment and operating margins that are significantly higher than our regular restaurant operations. As such, we believe they are an important driver in increasing our market penetration.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[813]">Dessert Centers represented 31.1% of our transactions and 10.1% of our total sales in 2015 and, with a return on investment of 139% in 2015, provide a low-risk investment alternative.

Our chicken-based offerings include bone-in chicken in markets such as Colombia, Peru, Panama and Costa Rica. We also provide Angus burgers with innovative flavors and premium offerings, such as Grand Big Mac and Big Cheddar McMelt in Brazil. Also, we carefully monitor the sales of our products and are able to quickly modify them if necessary.

As of December 31, 2013, we had implemented MFY in almost all of our Company-operated restaurants in Argentina, Aruba, Brazil, Curaçao, French Guiana, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

In addition, we continue to benefit from the Hamburger Universities in the United States and Brazil and the food studio located in Brazil that aims to develop locally relevant products for the region. The Hamburger Universities and the food studio models have been McDonald's main global source of people and product development. The Hamburger Universities provide restaurant managers, mid-managers and owner/operators with training on best practices in different aspects of the business, like restaurant and people management, sales and accounting, while emphasizing consistent restaurant operations procedures, service, quality and cleanliness.

We also examine trends in the pricing of raw materials, packaging, product-related operating costs as well as individual item sales volumes to fully understand profitability by item. In addition, we use international consultants with particular experience in this area to understand marketplace dynamics and consumer characteristics. These insights feed into the local markets' menu and pricing strategy as well as the marketing plan that is disseminated to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants. Restaurants may then adjust pricing and/or item offerings as they choose in an attempt to optimize sales, profitability and local preferences.

Currently, we have an integrated and centralized supply chain management system that focuses on (i) the highest possible quality and food safety, (ii) competitive market pricing that is predictable and sustainable over time, and (iii) leveraging of local, regional and global sourcing strategies to obtain a competitive advantage. This system consists of the selection and development of suppliers that are able to comply with McDonald's high quality standards and the establishment of the appropriate type of relationships with these suppliers. These standards, which are based on the highest industry standards, such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards, British Retail Consortium (BRC) standards and others, include cleanliness, product consistency and timeliness, meeting or exceeding all local food regulations and compliance with our Hazard Analysis Critical Control Plan, or HACCP, a systematic approach to food safety that emphasizes protection within the processing facility, rather than detection, through analysis, inspection and follow-up. Due to our supply chain management and high quality standards, we believe our products have a competitive advantage because they have many attributes that make them appealing to our customers. For instance, our McNuggets are made of 100% white meat; our frying oil is 100% free of trans fatty acids; the dairy mix for our sundaes and the McFlurry undergo aseptic processes to rid them of bacteria; our vegetables are washed and sanitized; and our hamburger patties are made with 100% beef and do not contain additives.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[898]">Pursuant to the MFAs, we purchase core products and services, such as beef, chicken, buns, produce, cheese, dairy mixes and toppings, from approved suppliers and distributors who satisfy the above requirements. If McDonald's determines that any product or service offered by an approved supplier is not in compliance with its standards, it may terminate the supplier's approved status. Beyond the purchase of core products and services, we have no restrictions on which suppliers or distributors we may use. We have largely continued the supply relationships that McDonald's had established prior to the Acquisition, and we develop relationships with new suppliers in accordance with McDonald's Supplier Quality Management System, or SQMS.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[900]">Since the process to become an approved supplier is lengthy, expensive and requires proof of compliance with McDonald's high quality standards, we have found that oral agreements with our approved suppliers generally are sufficient to ensure a reliable supply of quality food products, and we have developed long-term relationships with many of our suppliers. In addition, we enter into written agreements with most of our suppliers regarding the cost of such goods, which can be based on pricing protocols, formula costing, benchmarking or open bidding, as appropriate. Our 35 largest suppliers account for approximately 80% of our supplies, and no single supplier or group of related suppliers account for more than 12% of our total food and paper costs. Among our main suppliers are JBS S.A., McCain Foods Limited, The Coca-Cola Company, Bimbo SA and Arytza SA.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[902]">Our integrated supply chain management optimizes value as we work with suppliers to develop pricing protocols, inventory, planning and product quality. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 25% of the food and paper products used in our restaurants were imported, primarily from countries within Latin America, while the remaining amount were locally sourced. This percentage varies among the Territories; for example, 16% of the products consumed in Mexico are imported, while 19% and 90% of the products consumed in Brazil and the Caribbean division, respectively, are imported. This includes the toys distributed in our restaurants, which are imported from China. Certain supplies, such as beef, must often be locally sourced due to restrictions on their importation. Combined with the MFAs' requirement to purchase certain core supplies from approved suppliers, although we maintain contingency plans to back up restaurant supplies, we may not be able to quickly find alternate or additional supplies in the event a supplier is unable to meet our orders. See "ITEM 3. Key Information-D. Risk Factors-Certain Factors Relating to Our Business-We depend on oral agreements with third-party suppliers and distributors for the provision of products that are necessary for our operations." The suppliers send all of their products to distribution centers that are in charge of transportation, warehousing, financial administration, demand and inventory planning and customer service. The distribution centers interact directly with our Company-operated and franchised restaurants.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[904]">Until March 16, 2011, we owned and operated some of the distribution centers in the Territories, which operations and related properties we refer to as Axionlog (formerly known as Axis).

We work with our suppliers to implement key standards testing at each stage of our supply chain, including raw materials, processing and distribution. With respect to raw materials, we verify that produce suppliers undergo verification audits. All protein suppliers also undergo Animal Welfare Policy, "mad cow" disease and HACCP audits. At the processing stage, we implement a supplier quality management system that encourages continuous improvement in each key product category. We conduct seminars annually with all key suppliers on topics such as standards calibration, product sensory evaluation and best practices, and all suppliers are audited annually by a third party for compliance with McDonalds's SQMS. As members of the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI), we encourage our suppliers to adopt any norm under the umbrella of GFSI that is recognized globally. We measure compliance through visits to processing plants, supplier summits, regularly scheduled audits and sensory testing that is achieved through a combination of product, equipment and operational procedures. At the distribution stage, we have implemented the Distribution Quality Management Program, which includes a shelf-life management system, strict temperature controls for receiving and storage of food products, a sophisticated stock recovery program and a quality inspection program.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[910]">Our quality testing extends to restaurant operations.

We participate in the restaurant operations improvement process designed by McDonald's, under which Company-operated and franchised restaurants are visited at least three times in any 21-month cycle to identify system opportunities to continuously improve our operations. Visits are conducted by our operation consultants, who assess restaurants based on food quality, service and cleanliness. We also participate in the worldwide mystery shopper program designed by McDonald's, where all restaurants are visited twice a month by a third-party vendor who provides us with feedback from a customer perspective. This feedback, called customer satisfaction opportunity reports, is sent to a centralized monitoring system that evaluates key operations indicators.

As a business focused on young adults in the 14 to 35 age range and families with children, our operations have benefited, and we expect to continue to benefit, from our Territories' population size, age profile when compared to more developed markets and improving socio-economic conditions.

In addition, improvements in macroeconomic conditions in the Territories have led to a modernization of consumption patterns and increased affordability of our products across socio-economic segments, and we believe we are well placed to capitalize on these trends. In Brazil alone, distribution of national income significantly improved between 2003 and 2013. In 2003, 60% of population accounted for 17% of the total national income, while in 2013 60% of the population accounted for 23.3% of the total national income, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.

The Fair Price Act generally sets forth a profit cap of 30% on the cost structure of goods and services, thus reducing management's ability to freely determine final prices. According to regulations passed under the Fair Price Act, to determine a final and fair price, management must observe and consider all the costs of production, including (i) acquisition costs of raw materials, the determination of which shall comply with existing regulations on transfer pricing (i.e., price, freight, primary storage, non-recoverable taxes and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition of raw materials), (ii) labor costs, and (iii) indirect costs of production.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[932]">The Fair Price Act empowers the National Agency for the Defense of Socio-economic Rights (</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[932]/html:i[1]">Sundde</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[932]">) to implement provisions and regulations on "fair pricing" and to oversee and audit businesses in Venezuela.

Key Information-A. Selected Financial Data." Systemwide results are driven primarily by our Company-operated restaurants, as 74.2% of our systemwide restaurants are Company-operated as of December 31, 2015. Systemwide data represents measures for both Company-operated and franchised restaurants. While sales by franchisees are not recorded as revenues by us, management believes the information is important in understanding our financial performance because these sales are the basis on which we calculate and record franchised restaurant revenues and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base.

Comparable sales are driven by changes in traffic and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in sales from the prior year for all restaurants in operation for at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may close temporarily include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. With respect to restaurants where there are changes in ownership, all previous months' sales are reclassified according to the new ownership category when reporting comparable sales. As a result, there will be discrepancies between the sales figures used to calculate comparable sales and our results of operations. We report on a calendar basis, and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period for the prior year is impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays, weekend days and timing of holidays in a period can impact comparable sales positively or negatively. We refer to these impacts as calendar shift / trading day adjustments. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales while annual impacts are typically minimal.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[1111]">We calculate and analyze comparable sales and average check in our divisions and systemwide on a constant-currency basis, which means they are calculated using the same exchange rate in the applicable division or systemwide, as applicable, over the periods under comparison to remove the effects of currency fluctuations from the analysis.

The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. We periodically review these lives relative to physical factors, economic considerations and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.

Our valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 amounted to $297.9 million, $301.0 million and $270.1 million, respectively. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. This assessment is carried out on the basis of internal projections, which are updated to reflect our most recent operating trends, such as the expiration date for tax loss carryforwards. Because of the imprecision inherent in any forward-looking data, the further into the future our estimates project, the less objectively verifiable they become. Therefore, we apply judgment to define the period of time to include projected future income to support the future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward and whether there is sufficient evidence to support the projections at a more-likely-than-not level for this period of time. Determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary often requires an extensive analysis of positive (e.g., a history of accurately projecting income) and negative evidence (e.g., historic operating losses) regarding realization of the deferred tax assets and inherent in that, an assessment of the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income. In 2015 and 2014, we recognized a loss amounting to $49.5 million and $71.7 million, respectively, related to tax loss carryforwards for which realization is not expected to occur.

In particular, we have isolated the effects of appreciation and depreciation of local currencies in the Territories against the U.S. dollar because we believe that doing so is useful in understanding the development of our business. For these purposes, we eliminate the effect of movements in the exchange rates by converting the balances for both periods being compared from their local currencies to the U.S. dollar using the same exchange rate.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[1217]">Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[1219]">Set forth below are our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[1]/html:td[1]">For the Years Ended December 31, % Increase</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[2]/html:td[1]">2015 2014 (Decrease)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[3]/html:td[1]">(in thousands of U.S. dollars)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[4]/html:td[1]">Sales by Company-operated restaurants $2,930,379 $3,504,302 (16.4)%</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[5]/html:td[1]">Revenues from franchised restaurants 122,361 146,763 (16.6)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[6]/html:td[1]/html:b">Total revenues 3,052,740 3,651,065 (16.4)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[7]/html:td[1]">Company-operated restaurant expenses:</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[8]/html:td[1]">Food and paper (1,037,487) (1,243,907) (16.6)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[9]/html:td[1]">Payroll and employee benefits (616,358) (734,093) (16.0)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[10]/html:td[1]">Occupancy and other operating expenses (838,037) (997,065) (15.9)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[11]/html:td[1]">Royalty fees (149,089) (173,663) (14.2)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[12]/html:td[1]">Franchised restaurants - occupancy expenses (54,242) (63,939) (15.2)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[13]/html:td[1]">General and administrative expenses (270,680) (272,065) (0.5)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[14]/html:td[1]">Other operating income (expenses), net 6,560 (95,476) (106.9)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[15]/html:td[1]/html:b">Total operating costs and expenses (2,959,333) (3,580,208) (17.3)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[16]/html:td[1]">Operating income 93,407 70,857 31.8</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[17]/html:td[1]">Net interest expense (64,407) (72,750) (11.5)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[18]/html:td[1]">Loss from derivative instruments (2,894) (685) 322.5</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[19]/html:td[1]">Foreign currency exchange results (54,032) (74,117) (27.1)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[20]/html:td[1]">Other non-operating (expenses) income, net (627) 146 (529.5)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[21]/html:td[1]">Loss before income taxes (28,553) (76,549) (62.7)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[22]/html:td[1]">Income tax expense (22,816) (32,479) (29.8)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[23]/html:td[1]">Net loss (51,369) (109,028) (52.9)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[24]/html:td[1]">Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (264) (305) (13.4)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:table[113]/html:tr[25]/html:td[1]/html:b">Net loss attributable to Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc.

The lawsuit originally sought declaratory judgment and damages in the amount of $11 million plus plaintiffs' attorney's fees. In January 2008, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that increased the amount of damages sought to $66.7 million plus plaintiffs' attorney's fees. The complaint, as amended, requests that the court declare that the plaintiffs' respective franchise agreements and contractual relationships with McDonald's Corporation, which agreements and relationships were assigned or otherwise transferred to the Company as part of the Acquisition of the LatAm business, are governed by the Dealers' Act of Puerto Rico, or "Law 75", a Puerto Rican law that limits the grounds under which a principal may refuse to renew or terminate a distribution contract. The complaint also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions to restrict the Company from declining to renew the plaintiffs' agreements except for just cause, and to prohibit the Company from opening restaurants or kiosks within a three-mile radius of a franchisee's restaurant. In September 2008, the Company filed a counter-suit requesting the termination of the franchise agreements with these franchisees due to several material breaches. On December 23, 2010, the Commissioner assigned by the Court of First Instance to this case issued a resolution holding that Law 75 applies to the parties' commercial relationship. On July 20, 2011, the Court of First Instance adopted the Commissioner's determination with respect to the application of Law 75. This determination is an interlocutory determination that defines the legislation applicable to the franchisee rights and obligations. Law 75 will be the applicable law during the trial process. After the trial conclusion, the Company can still reiterate in appeal the position that Law 75 does not apply to the franchised agreements. The franchisees will still need to demonstrate and prove that the franchisor has breached their respective contracts. Therefore, no provision has been recorded regarding this lawsuit because the Company believes that a final negative outcome has a low probability of occurrence.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2006]">Both parties have concluded discovery and the pretrial hearing was held on August 30, 2012. The trial commenced on September 10, 2012 and was heard by the court-assigned commissioner. At the end of 2014, plaintiffs finished their presentation of evidence and we have not yet started our presentation of evidence. We anticipate that the Commissioner will issue a recommendation of resolution to the Court of First Instance during 2016.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2008]">During 2014, another franchisee filed a complaint (the "related Puerto Rican franchisee lawsuit") against us and McDonald's USA, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of McDonald's Corporation), asserting a very similar claim to the one filed in the Puerto Rican franchisees lawsuit. The claim seeks declaratory judgment and damages in the amount of $30 million plus plaintiff's attorney's fees. Although this case is in its early stages, we believe that a final negative resolution has a low probability of occurrence, since its close resemblance to the Puerto Rican franchisees lawsuit.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2010]">Furthermore, on March 26, 2010, we filed a collection claim against Puerto Rico Owner Operator's Association ("PROA"), an association integrated by our franchisees that meets periodically to coordinate the development of promotional and marketing campaigns, for the reimbursement of the monetary contribution made during August 2007. On June 15, 2010, PROA, also known as the cooperative, filed a third party complaint and counterclaim (the "PROA claim") against us and other third party defendants, in the amount of $31 million. At that time, the association was formed solely by franchisees that are plaintiffs in the Puerto Rican franchisees lawsuit, described above. PROA's complaint requests breach of contract for withdrawing from the association (PROA's position is that we cannot resign to the cooperative) and collection of past contributions, among others. On June 9, 2014, after several motions for summary judgment duly filed and opposed by the parties, the Court entered a "Partial Summary Judgment and Resolution" in favor of PROA, before initiating the discovery phase, finding that we must participate</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[220]/html:p">93</para><para link="true" path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[221]/html:table/html:tr/html:td/html:a">TABLE OF CONTENTS</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2012]">and contribute funds to the association. However, the Court did not specify any amount for which we should be held liable, due to its preliminary and interlocutory nature, and the lack of discovery conducted regarding the amounts claimed by the plaintiffs. We are opposing this claim vigorously because we believe that there is no legal basis for it considering: (i) the obligation to contribute is not directed towards a cooperative, (ii) the franchise agreement does not contain a provision that makes it mandatory to participate in the cooperative, and (iii) PROA's by-laws state that participation in the cooperative is voluntary, among other arguments.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2014]">Pursuant to Section 9.3 of the Stock Purchase Agreement, McDonald's Corporation indemnifies the Company for certain Brazilian claims as well as for specific and limited claims arising from the Puerto Rican franchisees lawsuit.

The corporate statutes of the State of Delaware and the British Virgin Islands in many respects are similar, and the flexibility available under British Virgin Islands law has enabled us to adopt a memorandum of association and articles of association that will provide shareholders with rights that, except as described in this annual report, do not vary in any material respect from those they would enjoy if we were incorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law, or Delaware corporate law. Set forth below is a summary of some of the differences between provisions of the BVI Act applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in Delaware and their shareholders.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2176]">Director's Fiduciary Duties</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2178]">Under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He must not use his corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling stockholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, a director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2180]">British Virgin Islands law provides that every director of a British Virgin Islands company, in exercising his powers or performing his duties, shall act honestly and in good faith and in what the director believes to be in the best interests of the company. Additionally, the director shall exercise the care, diligence, and skill that a reasonable director would exercise in the same circumstances, taking into account the nature of the company, the nature of the decision and the position of the director and his responsibilities. In addition, British Virgin Islands law provides that a director shall exercise his powers as a director for a proper purpose and shall not act, or agree to the company acting, in a manner that contravenes British Virgin Islands law or the memorandum association or articles of association of the company.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2182]">Amendment of Governing Documents</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2184]">Under Delaware corporate law, with very limited exceptions, a vote of the shareholders is required to amend the certificate of incorporation.

An interested shareholder generally is a person or group that owns or owned 15% or more of the target's outstanding voting stock within the past three years.

The amount of the gain or loss will equal the difference between the U.S. Holder's tax basis in the class A shares disposed of and the amount realized on the disposition, in each case as determined in U.S. dollars.

The amounts allocated to the taxable year of the sale or other disposition and to any year before we became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each other taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals or corporations, as appropriate, for that taxable year, and an interest charge would be imposed on the resulting tax liability for each taxable year. Further, to the extent that any distribution received by a U.S. Holder on its class A shares exceeds 125% of the average of the annual distributions on the class A shares received during the preceding three years or such U.S. Holder's holding period, whichever is shorter, that distribution would be subject to taxation in the same manner as gain on the disposition of a share of a PFIC, described immediately above. If we were a PFIC, certain elections may be available that would result in alternative treatments (such as mark-to-market treatment) of the class A shares that differ from the treatment set forth in this paragraph.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2533]">In addition, if we were to be treated as a PFIC in a taxable year in which we pay a dividend with respect to any U.S. Holder or in a prior taxable year, the long-term capital gains rates discussed above with respect to dividends paid to certain non-corporate U.S. Holders would not apply.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2535]">If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder owned our class A shares, the U.S. Holder will generally be required to file IRS Form 8621 (or any successor form) with their annual U.S. federal income tax returns, subject to certain exceptions.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2537]">Information Reporting and Backup Withholding</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2539]">Payments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the United States or through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries generally are subject to information reporting, and may be subject to backup withholding, unless (i) the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient or (ii) in the case of backup withholding, the U.S. Holder provides a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[266]/html:p">116</para><para link="true" path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[267]/html:table/html:tr/html:td/html:a">TABLE OF CONTENTS</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2541]">The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the holder's U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[2543]">Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals (and under recently finalized Treasury Regulations, specified entities that are formed or availed of for purposes of holding certain foreign financial assets) may be required to report information relating to their ownership of stock of a non-U.S. person, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for stock held in certain accounts maintained by a U.S. financial institution).

In accordance with the guidance within ASC 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, goodwill is stated at cost and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. The annual impairment test is mostly performed during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and compares the fair value of each reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill. As a result of the analyses performed during fiscal years 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded impairment charges of $679 in Argentina and $2,029 in Puerto Rico, respectively, related to goodwill generated in the acquisition of franchised restaurants. The impairments are included within "Other operating expenses, net" in the consolidated statements of income.

In accordance with this plan, in fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2010 the Company granted units (called "CADs") to certain employees, pursuant to which the employees are entitled to receive, when vested, a cash payment equal to the appreciation in fair value over the base value. During March 2015, the total amount of awards was vested. Exercisable outstanding awards at the date of termination are automatically settled by the Company. In April 2014, the Company communicated to its employees the three years expiration extension of ADBV Long-Term Incentive Plan outstanding units exercise right, without any change in the vesting period. Upon this resolution, units for which its exercise right was originally scheduled to expire in May, 2014 will expire in May, 2017, and units for which its exercise right was originally scheduled to expire in May, 2015 will expire in May, 2018. The employees affected by this resolution were 84. The total incremental compensation cost resulting from the modification for fiscal year 2015 and 2014 amounts to a gain of $511 and a loss of $149, respectively, which has been recorded under "General and administrative expenses".

The transaction is based on a hypothetical transaction in the principal or most advantageous market considered from the perspective of the market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability. The valuation techniques that can be used under this guidance are the market approach, income approach or cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other information for market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities, such as matrix pricing. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted present amount based on current market conditions about those future amounts, such as present value techniques, option pricing models (e.g. Black-Scholes model) and binomial models (e.g. Monte-Carlo model). The cost approach is based on current replacement cost to replace an asset.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:p[3691]">The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants who are independent, knowledgeable and willing and able to transact would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. The Company attempts to utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company is able to classify fair value balances based on the observance of those inputs. The guidance establishes a formal fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value.

Businesses and IT service providers use our solutions to deliver end-user support and to remotely access and manage computers and other Internet-enabled devices more effectively and efficiently. Consumers and mobile workers use our solutions to access computer resources remotely, thereby facilitating their mobility and increasing their productivity. Our solutions, which are deployed on-demand and accessible through a web browser, are secure, scalable and easy for our customers to try, purchase and use.

The majority of our customers subscribe to our services on an annual basis. We sell our premium services at prices ranging from approximately $30 to $1,900 per year. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, our average transaction price was approximately $153, and we completed over 120,000 transactions. Our revenue is driven primarily by the number and type of our premium services for which our paying customers subscribe. For the three months ended March 31, 2009, we generated revenues of $17.2 million, compared to $9.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008, an increase of approximately 73%.

The agreement provides that Intel will market and sell the services to its customers. Intel pays us a minimum license and service fee on a quarterly basis during the term of the agreement, and we and Intel share revenue generated by the use of the services by third parties to the extent it exceeds the minimum payments. We began recognizing revenue associated with the Intel service and marketing agreement in the quarter ended September 30, 2008.

A smaller percentage of our customers subscribe to our services on a monthly basis through either month-to-month commitments or annual commitments that are then paid monthly with a credit card. We initially record a subscription fee as deferred revenue and then recognize it ratably, on a daily basis, over the life of the subscription period. Typically, a subscription automatically renews at the end of a subscription period unless the customer specifically terminates it prior to the end of the period. Approximately 94% of our subscriptions have a one-year term. For the three months ended March 31, 2009, our dollar-weighted average renewal rate was approximately 80%. The dollar-weighted average renewal rate is the percentage of our subscriptions, on a dollar basis, that could have terminated during the three months ended March 31, 2009, in accordance with the terms of the subscription agreements but which were renewed.

Deferred tax assets, related valuation allowances, current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities are determined separately by tax jurisdiction. In making these determinations, we estimate tax assets, related valuation allowances, current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities, and we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. At December 31, 2008, our deferred tax assets consisted primarily of net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2008, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $19.2 million and $18.1 million, respectively, which expire at varying dates through 2028 for U.S. federal income tax purposes and primarily through 2013 for state income tax purposes. We used approximately $2.7 million of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards during the three month period ended March 31, 2009. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized, and we recognize a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction. To date, we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.

As a result, if factors change, and we use different assumptions, our share-based compensation could be materially different in the future. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on a U.S. Treasury instrument with a term similar to the expected term of the share-based award. The expected term of options has been estimated utilizing the vesting period of the option, the contractual life of the option and our option exercise history. Because there was no public market for our common stock prior to this offering, we lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, we estimate our expected stock volatility based on that of publicly-traded peer companies, and we expect to continue to use this methodology until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our publicly-traded stock price. Also, SFAS 123R requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options that are expected to vest.

The common stock per share value was based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future values considering each of the possible outcomes, as well as the rights of common and preferred stockholders. The possible outcomes considered in the valuation were a liquidation event in the form of an initial public offering, or an IPO scenario, a sale or merger assuming we continue to experience significant growth, or a growth scenario, a sale or merger assuming we continue to grow but not at a desired rate, but that our intellectual property would separately be of interest to an acquirer, or a technology scenario, our continued operation as a private company in which we have not experienced significant growth, or a private company scenario, and a dissolution of the company.

The growth scenario utilized completed sale transactions involving companies in the application software industry. To calculate the theoretical terminal value under the growth scenario, Shields utilized the median multiple of completed sales transactions in the software industry for the one-year period ending July 31, 2006. Many of these completed sales transactions involved more mature, lower growth companies. Accordingly, Shields refined the list of completed sale transactions to include only comparable companies based on our size and growth projections. The resulting multiple was a 20% premium to the median multiple of all completed sale transactions and was used by Shields in determining our theoretical terminal value under the growth scenario. The technology scenario assumed that we still met our short-term projected operating results but could not obtain and attract the high revenue growth multiples beyond our short-term operating results. The private company scenario assumed we continued in operation but did not meet our growth projections. Shields applied a growth rate of 3% to the normalized annual free cash flow to compute the theoretical value under the private company scenario.

Shields then weighted those costs based on the debt-to-equity ratio associated with our optimal capital structure, as of the valuation date. Based on these calculations, discussions with management management, Shields' analysis of our projections, and our stage of development as of the valuation date, we and Shields believe a 50% discount rate is appropriate and that our equity holders would require a rate of return similar to that as outlined in the AICPA Practice Aid for venture capital investors. The implied equity value per common share under each scenario was weighted based on estimates of the probability of each of the five scenarios by management management, the board of directors and Shields.

In its retrospective fair market valuation report, Shields considered the valuation methodologies outlined in the AICPA Practice Aid.

Specifically, in 2007, our financial results improved significantly, including positive cash flow from operations. The option-pricing method is more appropriate than the probability-weighted expected return method once a company's operations have matured enough to indicate that the company may have unlimited potential liquidity options over the course of its lifecycle, and assumptions of any one particular scenario, as is done in the probability-weighted expected return method, would be highly speculative. Based on the market conditions at the time and our improving operating performance, we began to believe that completing an initial public offering was possible.

As a result of the forward-looking methodology utilized by investors, Shields adjusted its analyses by placing more weight on the forward-looking methodologies.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[43]/html:div[3]">Under the option-pricing method, the common stock is priced under the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on an analysis of guideline companies, precedent transactions and discounted cash flow. The option-pricing model is sensitive to the following key assumptions: the underlying asset value, liquidation preferences, volatility, time to liquidity, and the risk-free rate. The underlying-asset value is the market price of the underlying security on which the option is based. Our underlying-asset value was determined by taking a weighted average of the equity values that resulted from the guideline companies, precedent transaction and discounted cash flow analyses. The liquidation preferences are the amounts at which an investor is indifferent between exercising the option or not. Our preferred stockholders have the right to participate with the common stockholders until they receive an amount equal to two times the original purchase price per share of preferred stock. The conversion rights of the preferred stockholders were considered in determining the per share value of our common stock. In analyzing guideline companies in the remote systems software industry, Shields identified eight publicly-traded guideline companies for the purpose of estimating our fair market value as of each valuation date. Of these, Shields determined that one publicly-traded company, Citrix Systems, Inc., or Citrix, is the most comparable to us in that they provide products that are very similar to and are directly competitive with our products, while the other companies identified had more diverse product offerings and did not compete directly with us. As a result, we believe it is appropriate to use Citrix as our representative public company. Accordingly, as of each valuation date our volatility was based on Citrix's volatility. However, in determining our volatility Shields elected not to base our volatility only on the volatility of Citrix and determined it to be more representative of our volatility to also include other publicly traded guideline companies. Thus, as of each valuation date the volatility of Citrix was increased by ten percentage points to more closely reflect the median volatility of the publicly traded guideline companies. Time to liquidity is an estimated earliest exit date to effect a transaction. For the purpose of these analyses this was based on estimates, from management management and our investment bankers, of when an initial public offering might occur. The risk-free rate of return is deemed to be the rate of return on a less risky security. As of each valuation date, the risk-free rate of return was determined by utilizing the return of U.S. treasury notes with maturities consistent with our time to liquidity. These assumptions represent management management's and Shields' best estimates, but involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[43]/html:div[5]">Under the guideline company analysis, we used the revenue trading multiples of our representative public company. Under the precedent transactions analysis, we identified completed sale transactions of software companies in a similar market to us that were completed in the prior twelve months.

In determining the appropriate discount rate, Shields constructed a weighted average cost of capital which determined our cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt, and then weighed those costs based on the debt-to-equity ratio associated with our optimal capital structure, as of each valuation date.

As a result of this determination, the exercise price of the options granted on January 24, 2007 was less than the fair value of our common stock. Consequently, the fair value of the stock options calculated pursuant to SFAS 123R increased to $1,457,000 from $371,000, and this increased value will be recorded as stock compensation expense over the vesting period of the options, which is generally four years.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[44]/html:div[8]">Additionally, certain of the options granted on January 24, 2007 are performance-based options, as defined under SFAS 123R.

The respective valuation methodologies used to calculate the underlying asset value of the company were updated as of the valuation date. Under the completed sales transaction analysis, Shields updated the revenue multiple for the acquisition of WebEx by Cisco Systems, which was announced on March 15, 2007. A portion of WebEx's business business competes directly with us and therefore was relevant to our valuation.

The increase was largely due to an increase in the multiple for completed sales transactions as a result of the WebEx acquisition. Following a review of this retrospective valuation and the objective and subjective factors previously reviewed, our board of directors retrospectively determined that the fair value of our common stock as of April 27, 2007 was $5.60 per share. Thus, the exercise price of the options granted on April 27, 2007 was less than the reassessed fair value of our common stock. Consequently, the fair value of the stock options calculated pursuant to SFAS 123R increased to $476,000 from $58,000. This increased value will be recorded as stock compensation expense over the vesting period of these options, which range from two to four years. In order to mitigate the potential unfavorable tax consequences to individuals holding options granted on April 27, 2007, on April 18, 2008, our board of directors approved a plan to allow the affected option holders to amend the exercise prices of their original options from $1.25 to $5.60 per share. As part of this amendment, we will compensate the affected option holders of 80,000 shares who elected to amend their options for the difference in the exercise price with a cash bonus payment upon the vesting of the respective stock option. The financial impact from the change in the valuation as a result of this amendment is approximately $283,000, of which approximately $209,000 has been recorded as stock compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2008, and approximately</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[44]/html:p">40</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[45]/html:div[1]">$31,000 has been recorded as stock compensation expense during the three month period ended March 31, 2009.

We also had preliminary discussions during this period with third parties interested in potentially acquiring the company. While these inquiries were very preliminary, our board of directors considered the various exit scenarios presented by these inquiries. Our board of directors and management management began to more seriously consider the possibility of an initial public offering and continued to discuss this scenario with several investment banks. Additionally, three founding employees began discussions to sell up to 19% of their common stock to three of our largest stockholders. During July and August 2007, the three founding employees and five other smaller stockholders, including several non-employee stockholders, sold an aggregate of 719,068 shares of common stock at $9.73 per share and 71,522 shares of preferred stock at $3.89 per share to existing stockholders, representing an aggregate purchase price of approximately $7,271,000.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[45]/html:div[10]">Shields factored the founding employees' equity transaction into its analyses and retrospective valuation, placing more weight on the forward-looking methodologies because the negotiated purchase price was predominantly derived by applying a revenue multiple to our projected revenues. Our weightings were adjusted to 60% on projected financial results, increased from 15% in the previous valuation, and 40% to current financial results, decreased from 85% in the previous valuation. The weightings used for the guideline company analysis based on historical results were decreased to 10% from 45% while the weighting used for projected results was increased to 15% from 5%. The weighting used for the completed sale transaction analysis based on historical results was decreased to 30% from 40% while the weighting used for projected results was increased to 15% from 5%. Finally, as a result of our improved performance and the founding employees' equity transaction, the discounted cash flow weighting was increased to 30% from 5%. The expected term was updated to June 2008, from December 2009, based on our more substantive discussions with investment bankers regarding the possibility of an initial public offering or other liquidity event.

The increase was largely due to the weighting shift to projected financial results from current financial results. Following a review of this retrospective valuation and the objective and subjective factors previously reviewed, our board of directors retrospectively determined that the fair value of our common stock as of July 17, 2007 was $8.62 per share. As a result of this determination, the exercise price of the options granted on August 3, 2007 was greater than the fair market value of our common stock for accounting purposes. Consequently, the fair value of the stock options calculated pursuant to SFAS 123R decreased slightly to $459,000 from $490,000, and this decreased value will be recorded as stock compensation expense over the vesting period of the options, which is generally four years.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[45]/html:div[14]/html:b">Stock Option Grants on November 5, 2007</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[45]/html:div[16]">Our board of directors granted stock options on November 5, 2007, with each option having an exercise price of $9.65 per share.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[45]/html:div[18]">During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, we continued to operate our business business in the ordinary course.

The resulting fair value of our common stock as of November 21, 2007 was $9.35 per common share, a decrease of $0.30 from the previous valuation report. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the revenue multiple of our representative company, a decrease in our estimated volatility and a reduction in our estimated time to liquidity. The reduction in revenue multiple and estimated volatility was due to a decrease in our representative company's actual stock price and volatility since the previous valuation report. The reduction in our estimated time to liquidity was due to the passage of time since the previous valuation report and not a change in the estimated date of a liquidity event. Additionally, our per share enterprise value decreased due to an increase of 760,000 shares of common stock associated with an increase in the shares of common stock approved under our 2007 stock incentive plan, which at the time we intended to grant prior to the estimated date of a liquidity event in the valuation report. Following a review of this valuation report and the objective and subjective factors previously reviewed, our board of directors determined that the fair value of our common stock as of November 21, 2007 was $9.35 per share.

As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 15% for 2007 versus 18% for 2006. The decrease in costs of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of more efficient utilization of our data center and customer support organizations. The increase in absolute dollars primarily resulted from an increase in both the number of customers using our premium services and the total number of devices that connected to our services, including devices owned by free users, which resulted in increased hosting and customer support costs. The total number of devices connected to our service increased to approximately 32 million as of 2007 from approximately 13 million as of 2006. Of the increase in cost of revenue, $1.1 million resulted from increased data center costs associated with the hosting of our services. The increase in data center costs was due to expansion of our data center facilities as we added capacity to our hosting infrastructure, including the establishment of two new data centers in 2007, including one in Europe and one in the United States.

As of March 31, 2009, our users have connected over 70 million computers and other Internet-enabled devices to a LogMeIn service, and during the three months ended March 31, 2009, the total number of devices connected to our service grew at an average of approximately 95,000 per day.

Workers are spending less of their time in a traditional office environment and are increasingly telecommuting and traveling with Internet-enabled devices. According to IDC Research, or IDC, the percentage of the global workforce that works remotely will increase from approximately 25% in 2006 to 30% in 2011, to a total of 1 billion workers. This trend increases the demand for remote connectivity for workers and for IT professionals who support and manage their computers and other Internet-enabled devices.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[63]/html:table/html:tr[4]/html:td[1]">• Increasing use of IT outsourcing by SMBs. SMBs generally have limited internal IT expertise and IT budgets and are therefore increasingly turning to third-party service providers to manage the complexity of IT services at an affordable cost. For example, based on Forrester's "Enterprise and SMB Hardware Survey, North America and Europe, Q3 2008" published on December 18, 2008, Forrester estimates that out of 1,723 respondents, 22% of SMBs outsource their PC and laptop support to third-party service providers and that an additional 12% of SMBs plan to do so in the next 12 months. SMBs are also looking to third-party service providers to manage their servers. The same survey estimates that 28% of SMBs already outsource server management management responsibilities and another 13% are planning to in the next 12 months. We believe that IT service providers will increasingly turn to on-demand, remote-connectivity solutions to help address the growing demand for outsourced support and management management of these computers. IDC estimates that the installed base of commercial personal computers and servers in the United States will increase from 148.6 million in 2006 to 196.8 million in 2011. We estimate that more than 50% of these personal computers and servers are or will be used by SMBs.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[63]/html:table/html:tr[6]/html:td[1]">• Growing adoption of on-demand solutions. By accessing hosted, on-demand solutions through a Web browser, companies can avoid the time and costs associated with installing, configuring and maintaining IT support applications within their existing IT infrastructure. These advantages are leading companies to adopt on-demand solutions at an increasing rate. For example, IDC estimates that the global on-demand software market reached $6.2 billion in 2007 and expects it to increase to $19.8 billion in 2012, a compounded annual growth rate of 26%.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[63]/html:table/html:tr[8]/html:td[1]">• Increasing need to support the growing number of Internet-enabled consumer devices. Consumer adoption of Internet-enabled devices is growing rapidly. Manufacturers, retailers and service providers struggle to provide cost-effective support for these devices and often turn to remote support and management management solutions in order to increase customer satisfaction while lowering the cost of providing that support. We believe the need for remote support services for consumers will increase rapidly as they purchase more PCs and Internet-enabled consumer electronics. IDC estimates that the worldwide installed base of consumer-owned personal computers will grow from 443.9 million in 2007 to 700.9 million in 2011, a compound annual growth rate of 12%. In addition, the research firm Strategy Analytics estimates that the installed base of Internet-enabled consumer electronics devices, such as game consoles, televisions and set top boxes, will grow from 36 million in 2006 to 400 million worldwide in 2010.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[63]/html:table/html:tr[10]/html:td[1]">• Proliferation of Internet-enabled mobile devices (Smartphones). Mobile devices are increasingly being used for Internet-based computing and communications. IDC estimates that 152 million converged mobile devices were shipped worldwide in 2008, and annual shipments are expected to grow to more than 312 million by 2013, which represents a compound annual growth rate of 16%. We believe the rapid proliferation and increasing functionality of these devices create a growing need for remote support of these devices.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[63]/html:div[4]">Remote-connectivity technology has existed for many years. However, most solutions have been delivered as either hardware or software products designed to operate on the customer's premises. These solutions typically require time and technical expertise to configure and deploy. They also often require ongoing maintenance, as they can fail when networking environments change. As a result, most traditional remote-connectivity solutions are best suited for large organizations with onsite IT staff. Because of the setup and maintenance costs, technical complexity and connection failure rates, we believe these traditional remote-access technologies are not suitable for many SMBs and consumers.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[63]/html:p">59</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[64]/html:div[1]/html:b/html:font">Our Solutions</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[64]/html:div[3]">Our solutions allow our users to remotely access, support and manage computers and other Internet-enabled devices on demand.

While more than 90% of our users do not currently pay for our services, our cost of revenue, including the cost to deliver our services to these free users, was only 10% of our total revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2009.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[65]/html:table[2]/html:tr[4]/html:td[1]">• On-demand delivery.

Our average transaction price was approximately $153 during the three months ended March 31, 2009, and we completed over 120,000 transactions during this time.

In determining the equity awards for each of these executives, our board of directors took into account our overall performance as a company, the applicable executive's overall performance and contribution to our overall performance as a company, the size of awards granted to other executives and senior employees, the size of the available option pool and the recommendations of management management. In January 2007, our board of directors determined that our overall company performance had been strong in 2006 and that Messrs. Simon, Anka and Harrison had performed well and contributed to our overall performance as a company. In making these grants, our board of directors also considered the portion of the prior equity grants that had not yet vested, and their value as a retention tool. In the case of Messrs. Simon, Anka and Harrison, a large portion of their prior option grants had already vested. As a result, in January 2007, our board of directors granted options to Messrs. Simon, Anka and Harrison to purchase 90,000, 90,000 and 20,000 shares, respectively. The exercise price of these options is $1.25 per share. The options to purchase 90,000 granted to Messrs. Simon and Anka are performance-based with vesting triggered upon the successful completion of a public offering or other liquidation event at predefined values of the company. In November 2007, our board of directors determined that our overall company performance had been strong in 2007 and that Messrs. Simon, Anka, Kelliher and Harrison had performed well and contributed to our overall performance as a company. In making these grants, our board of directors also considered the need to retain these individuals in the event we become a public company, the portion of the prior equity grants that had not yet vested, and their value as a retention tool. In the case of Messrs. Simon, Anka, Kelliher and Harrison, a large portion of their prior options grants had already vested, and the board determined that there is a need to retain these individuals in the event we become a public company.

The three levels are as follows:</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[129]/html:div[12]">Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets accessible by the Company at the measurement date.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[129]/html:div[14]">Level 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[129]/html:div[16]">Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[129]/html:p">F-14</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:div[1]">The following table summarizes the basis used to measure certain of the Company's financial assets that are carried at fair value:</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[1]/html:tr[2]/html:td[1]">Basis of Fair Value Measurement</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[1]/html:tr[3]/html:td[1]">Quoted Prices</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[1]/html:tr[4]/html:td[1]">in Active Significant</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[1]/html:tr[5]/html:td[1]">Markets for Other Significant</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[1]/html:tr[6]/html:td[1]">Balance at Identical Observable Unobservable</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[1]/html:tr[7]/html:td[1]">December 31, Items Inputs Inputs</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[1]/html:tr[8]/html:td[1]">2008 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[1]/html:tr[10]/html:td[1]">Cash equivalents - money market funds $19,322,320 $19,322,320 $- $-</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[2]/html:tr[2]/html:td[1]">Basis of Fair Value Measurement</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[2]/html:tr[3]/html:td[1]">Quoted Prices</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[2]/html:tr[4]/html:td[1]">in Active Significant</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[2]/html:tr[5]/html:td[1]">Markets for Other Significant</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[2]/html:tr[6]/html:td[1]">Balance at Identical Observable Unobservable</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[2]/html:tr[7]/html:td[1]">March 31, Items Inputs Inputs</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[2]/html:tr[8]/html:td[1]">2009 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[2]/html:tr[9]/html:td[1]">(Unaudited)</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[2]/html:tr[11]/html:td[1]">Cash equivalents - money market funds $23,332,422 $23,332,422 $- $-</para><para path="/html:html/html:body/html:div[130]/html:table[3]/html:tr[2]/html:td[1]/html:b/html:font">4.
